Package allows to download current and historical METAR weather reports and decode basic parameters.

### METAR weather reports source web pages
The main functions scrap data from the below web pages:

1. For current reports, the function *metar_get*:

* Aviation Weather Center https://aviationweather.gov/data/metar</li><br>

2. For historical reports, the function *metar_get_historical*:

* Iowa Environmental Mesonet web page of Iowa State University
ASOS-AWOS-METAR http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/AWOS/</li>
* Weather Information Service http://www.ogimet.com/ developed by Guillermo Ballester Valor

Please take into consideration that the http://www.ogimet.com/ can block too frequent requests for data due to the server overload. <br>

### Locations of METAR stations
Information about the locations of the METAR stations / ariports were taken from two sources:

1. The first choice is the file from https://ourairports.com/data/ created by David Megginson.
2. If information can't be found, the second source is searched, the ADDS Station Table prepared by Greg Thompson NCAR/RAP. The file is available on the web page of Aviation Weather Center https://weather.ral.ucar.edu/surface/stations.txt 
from NOAA National Weather Service https://www.weather.gov/

The both above data sources are in the public domain.

#### Package pmetar is for extracting and parsing information, from current or historical METAR reports, only.

#### Don't use it for flight planning or navigation!

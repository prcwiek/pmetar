Package allows to download current and historical METAR weather reports
and decode basic parameters.

### METAR weather reports source web pages

The function metar\_get scraps data from two web pages:

1.  For current reports:

-   Aviation Weather Center <https://www.aviationweather.gov/metar>
    </li>
    <br>

1.  For historical reports:

-   Iowa Environmental Mesonet web page of Iowa State University
    ASOS-AWOS-METAR <http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/AWOS/>
    </li>
-   Weather Information Service <http://www.ogimet.com/> developed by
    Guillermo Ballester Valor

Please take into consideration that the <http://www.ogimet.com/> can
block too frequent requests for data due to the server overload. <br>

### Locations of METAR stations

Information about the locations of the METAR stations / ariports were
taken from two sources:

1.  The first choice is the file from <https://ourairports.com/data/>
    created by David Megginson.
2.  If information can’t be found, the second source is searched, the
    ADDS Station Table prepared by Greg Thompson NCAR/RAP. The file is
    available on the web page of Aviation Weather Center
    <https://www.aviationweather.gov/docs/metar/stations.txt> from NOAA
    National Weather Service <https://www.weather.gov/>

The both above data sources are in the public domain.

#### Package pmetar is for extracting and parsing information, from current or historical METAR reports, only.

#### Don’t use it for flight planning or navigation!

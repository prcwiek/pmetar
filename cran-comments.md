Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:  
  
  ASOS
  AWOS
  METAR
  Mesonet

Three mis-spelled words are the abbreviations:

METAR for Meteorological Terminal Aviation Routine Weather Report  
  
And the meaning of the last one Mesonet according to
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesonet> is "in meteorology (and
climatology), a mesonet, portmanteau of mesoscale network, is a network
of (typically) automated weather and environmental monitoring stations
designed to observe mesoscale meteorological phenomena."  

This is a new version 0.3.2 release.
